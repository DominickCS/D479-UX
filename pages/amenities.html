        Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a
        small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.
        Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and
        propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so
        larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few
        years.

        Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.
        Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in
        Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency
        near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several
        vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and
        very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton
        Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
